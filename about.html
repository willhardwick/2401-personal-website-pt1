            Hi, I'm Will Hardwick. I'm interested in a wide 
            range of communication arts, media, and technology
            and how these fields all intersect to create innovative
            and exciting products, engaging software and web 
            applications, and cohesive, refreshing brand identities 
            for businesses and professionals alike. I myself have 
            skillsets and work experience relevant to these fields, 
            such as photography for both e-commerce and promotional use, 
            social media management, creative direction, and graphic design. 
            Presently, I am primarily focused on building upon my 
            modest amount of skill and experience in web design and 
            software development in hopes to gain employment in a 
            related role.
            </p>
